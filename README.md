## Introduction

For this project I wanted to at the very least give it a little style, as well as keeping all of that functionality. I decided to go for something perfectly matching the style of the Cartoon, while still being simple and effective. 

For the styling  of the website, the background and the initial Locations, Characters and Episodes buttons, were generated using AI (Adobe Firefly).

Thank you for taking the time to review this, I hope you enjoy using it.
